# The Number Game

## Introduction
The number game is a simple guessing game where one has to guess a 4 digit number randomly generated by the computer based on some clues given regarding the number of correct digits.

## Rules of the Game

1. The Computer generates a random 4 digit number. The digits are between 1-9 and there are no repetitions

1. Your job is to guess the number in as few guesses as possible

1. When you enter a guess, the computer will tell how many digits you got right

1. If you got one digit right it will return 1 B

1. If you got a digit right but it is in the wrong place, it will return 1 C

1. For example, if the computer returns 2B 1C then your guessed number will have 2 digits in the right place and one digit which is correct but in the wrong place

1. While guessing, you cannot repeat digits in the number you guess
